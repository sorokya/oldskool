# Old Skool

An old skool forum software written in plain old PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a lot of jQuery.

## Why?

In a time when web applications are so complicated and bloated I've been feeling the urge to go back to when things used to be simple.

I'm making this software because I want to.

## How do I play with it?

The easiest way is with docker. Install docker and run the following commands:

```
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```
